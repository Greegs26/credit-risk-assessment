Project Folder Structure
Imagine your project folder as a big container where you keep everything organized. Here’s how you can organize it:

1. Main Project Folder (credit_risk_assessment)
This is the main folder where everything related to your project will be stored.

2. Data Folder (data)
Purpose: To store your datasets.
Subfolders:
raw: Contains the original datasets you collected.
processed: Contains the cleaned and prepared datasets you will use for analysis.
3. Notebooks Folder (notebooks)
Purpose: To store Jupyter notebooks.
Files:
eda.ipynb: A notebook where you do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand your data.
model_training.ipynb: A notebook where you build and train your machine learning models.
4. Source Code Folder (src)
Purpose: To store Python scripts for different tasks.
Files:
data_preprocessing.py: Code for cleaning and preparing your data.
feature_engineering.py: Code for creating new features from your data.
model.py: Code for building and training your machine learning models.
evaluation.py: Code for evaluating how well your models are performing.
5. Application Folder (app)
Purpose: To store files for deploying your project as a web application.
Files:
main.py: The main script for running your web application.
templates/: A folder for storing HTML templates for your web pages.
static/: A folder for storing static files like CSS and JavaScript.
6. Reports Folder (reports)
Purpose: To store reports generated from your analysis.
Files:
eda_report.pdf: A report summarizing your Exploratory Data Analysis.
model_report.pdf: A report summarizing your model performance.
7. Other Important Files
requirements.txt: A file listing all the Python packages your project needs to run.
README.md: A file explaining what your project is about and how to use it.
setup.py: A file to help install your project as a package (optional for beginners).
