Step 1: Collect the Data
Step 2: Clean and Preprocess the Data
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

Step 4: Feature Engineering 
Goal of Feature Engineering in a Credit Risk Assessment Project
Feature engineering is a crucial step in your project aimed at improving the performance of your machine learning models. It involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns in the data. Here's a detailed explanation of what you should aim to achieve with feature engineering:

1. Enhance Predictive Power
Create New Features: Derive new features that might provide better insights or stronger signals for predicting credit risk. For example, you can create features like the debt-to-income ratio, length of credit history, or average monthly spending.
Transform Existing Features: Apply mathematical transformations to existing features to capture non-linear relationships. For example, you might use log transformations for skewed data or polynomial features for non-linear patterns.
2. Improve Model Performance
Reduce Dimensionality: Combine or reduce features to eliminate redundancy and reduce noise in the data. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be useful here.
Handle Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.
Scale Features: Normalize or standardize features to ensure that they are on a similar scale, which can help improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.
3. Incorporate Domain Knowledge
Use Domain-Specific Insights: Leverage your knowledge of credit risk to create features that are known to be important predictors. For example, using the number of recent credit inquiries or the presence of delinquent accounts.
4. Simplify Model Interpretability
Create Intuitive Features: Sometimes, creating features that are easier to interpret can help in explaining the model’s decisions. For instance, instead of using raw income, you might use income categories (low, medium, high).
